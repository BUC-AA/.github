<h1 align="center">Bots Under Construction</h1>
<p align="center">Bots Under Construction is a community for bot developers, <br>whether physical robots or digital ones. Beginners, amateurs, and experts are all welcomed. </p>

**A few things about Bots Under Construction:**
1. We make stand-alone channels / threads for every bot (Excluding voice channels)
2. Every bot gets a separated role with your name, and you get the server contributor role
3. We are more than happy to receive bot adding requests
4. Still a very small community hoping to grow bigger
5. We strive to maintain a healthy community
6. We follow your bot announcements if you have a server, and if not you still get special permissions to post updates in that channel
7. English server
8. More plans and goals are coming when the server meets specific requirements :muscle:

**What you can do here:**
1. Add your bots
2. Improve or help others in bot developing or programming in general
3. Find people with similar interests
4. Test bots of your own and others' too
5. Get an own but public space for your bot (Your bot will be separated from members!)
6. Discuss your ideas or collaborate on projects
7. Join the project forum and update it as something similar to a journal
8. Participate in fun events
9. Request partnership with our server (Requirements are fairly low) 
10. Promote your projects 
11. Request for your GitHub logs to be featured
12. Join the server GitHub community organisation (Still growing)
13. Have your bot updates featured in the server
