# Bots Under Construction & Algorithm Architects
Bots Under Construction is a community for technology enthusiasts. 

Our community is divided into two aspects:
- Bot Developing - Bots Under Construction
- General Technology - Algorithm Architects

### Bots Under Construction
In Bots Under Construction, also known as BUC, we highlight several features for bot developers to feel belonged and appreciated.
- Individual threads showcasing each bot. We encourage you to enter a description so others can know more about your bot while they explore the bot threads available. (Your own bot's thread, but a public space!)
- You have a special role called [name]'s Bots. (e.g. If your name is Bob, your role will be "Bob's Bots".)
- Others can test your bots, and you can test others' bots. 

### Algorithm Architects
In Algorithm Architecture, we welcome every branch of technology. This is a more general aspect in our community, and bot developing can also be included!
- There is a forum for help regarding programming, learning, etc. (-Feel free to ask for help there, any programming language is allowed!)
- A sandbox forum to update your projects. (Similarly to a journal, you can post updates and share your journey while creating your builds.)

### Uncategorised Features
- Get your announcements followed. (Create a ticket sending the invite link to the server, along with the channel where you want us to add it to our server. Make sure it's an announcement channel related to your project. Only one channel per project.)
- Participate in fun events. (We organise events regularly, and you're always welcomed to join us!)
- Join the community [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/BUC-AA). (Our organisation is still growing, but we hope to share open-source projects of anything appropriate! You'll also get the `@GitHub Contributor` role.)
